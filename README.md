# LLM-Enhanced Product Recommendation System

A modular implementation of an advanced grocery product recommendation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for feature engineering and semantic understanding.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This thesis project demonstrates how LLMs can enhance traditional machine learning approaches for product recommendations by:

1. **Semantic Feature Engineering**: Using sentence transformers and OpenAI GPT models to create meaningful product embeddings and categories
2. **Network Analysis**: Building product co-occurrence networks for cross-selling opportunities
3. **Hybrid Scoring**: Combining ML predictions with business metrics for revenue optimization
4. **Basket Expansion**: Analyzing and predicting customer basket expansion potential

## 📁 Project Structure

The project has been modularized into focused components:
