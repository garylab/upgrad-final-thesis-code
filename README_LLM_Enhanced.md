## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost openai plotly python-dotenv matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn
```

### Setup
1. **Download Instacart Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
2. **Set up OpenAI API key** in `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Run the enhanced notebook**: `main_llm_enhanced.ipynb`

### Usage
```python
# Import the system
from llm_enhanced_system import (
    RevenueOptimizedFeatureEngine,
    LLMEnhancedRecommendationEngine,
    ABTestSimulator
)

# Create revenue features
feature_engine = RevenueOptimizedFeatureEngine(data)
enhanced_data = feature_engine.create_revenue_features()

# Train revenue-optimized model
predictor = RevenueOptimizedPredictor()
model = predictor.train(enhanced_data)

# Generate LLM-enhanced recommendations
recommender = LLMEnhancedRecommendationEngine(predictor)
recommendations, profile = recommender.generate_personalized_recommendations(
    user_id=123, data=enhanced_data, top_n=10
)
```
